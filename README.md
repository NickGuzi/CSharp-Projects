# CSharp-Projects
This respository is for the projects I created during the Tech Academy's C# and Unity Course 

## Projects

### Basic C# Programs
This project folder is full of basic c# mini assignments that I completed when learning the fundamentals of C#. It contains various .NET Framework console files ranging from Console.Write() statements to larger console programs that utilize classes, recieve user input, and perform calculations. 

### Twenty One
This project contains code files for a fully function Twenty One (Blackjack) game. I created this game with instructor aid at the Tech Academy and is a conglomeration of everything I learned from previous assignments contained in the Basic C# Programs folder.
